				<p id="text"><strong>EDGAR ALLAN POE,</strong><br/>"Sonnet&ndash;To My Mother"
<em>The Flag of Our Union</em>, Boston<br/>July 7, 1849</p>
				<p id="text">During the final year of his life, the only publication that would print any of Poe's writings&ndash;paying him money he desperately needed&ndash;was the Boston weekly newspaper <em>The Flag of Our Union</em>. The last four poems and last five short stories published during Poe's lifetime appeared in this popular publication that was then located in the Boston Museum Building at 24-26 Tremont Street. Poe's next to last poem was "For Annie," dedicated to his love in Lowell and published on April 28, 1849. <br/>The final piece published before his death was the poem "To My Mother," a sonnet written to his mother-in-law Maria Clemm that is also a tribute to Eliza Poe, "My mother&ndash;my own mother&ndash;who died early." He could not have known that he was closing a circle when this poem was published in the city of his birth on July 7, 1849. </p>
