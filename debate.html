            <p>Between his birth two blocks south of Boston Common on January 19, 1809 and his death in Baltimore on
              October 7, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe lived in many places—including Richmond, London, Philadelphia, New York,
              and, yes, Boston. In celebration of the opening of <a

                  style="text-transform:uppercase;">The Raven in the Frog Pond</span></a>, the Boston Public Library
              presents what has been called&nbsp;the Great Poe Debate, in which advocates for Baltimore, Boston, and
              Philadelphia make the case for their city's claim to the Poe legacy. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"Tuesday night’s Great Poe Debate at the Free Library of Philadelphia certainly lived up to its name. The
              event was front-page news in that day’s edition of The Philadelphia Inquirer (“Poe’s Heart Belong
              Elsewhere? Nevermore!”), and it drew a standing-room-only crowd to the library’s Montgomery Auditorium.
              That 400 people would turn out on a frigid Tuesday night for a literary debate qualifies as nothing short
              of miraculous. Anyone expecting scholarly presentations of dry facts and measured persuasion would have
              been sorely disappointed—not that I heard any complaints. This was more of a literary spectacle, a
              memorable and raucous
              affair that will be talked about for years." <br><b><span class="rev">Baltimore Magazine</span></b></p>
